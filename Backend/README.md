# Project Name
Otaku REST API

## Description
The Otaku REST API is a backend service developed using the Django REST Framework. It's designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing and accessing Otaku-related data.

This API features three main endpoints (`/auth/`, `/threads/`, `/anime/`), each serving a unique purpose in the application. The endpoints are well-documented with live, up-to-date documentation.

The Otaku REST API is easy to set up and run locally for development purposes, thanks to its use of a virtual environment and pip for dependency management. It's also designed with contribution in mind, making it easy for other developers to understand, use, and contribute to the project.
