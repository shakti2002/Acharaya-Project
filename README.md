## Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Backend

# Project Name
Otaku REST API

## Description
The Otaku REST API is a backend service developed using the Django REST Framework. It's designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing and accessing Otaku-related data.

This API features three main endpoints (`/auth/`, `/threads/`, `/anime/`), each serving a unique purpose in the application. The endpoints are well-documented with live, up-to-date documentation.

The Otaku REST API is easy to set up and run locally for development purposes, thanks to its use of a virtual environment and pip for dependency management. It's also designed with contribution in mind, making it easy for other developers to understand, use, and contribute to the project.
